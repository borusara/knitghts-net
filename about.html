         <h2>The Knights Association</h2>
         <p>A Chat based Telegram community to provide you with different kinds of content and AI services. The Knight's aim is to make a toxicity free telegram based community system and to provide you a comfortable Telegram time. Official tag "·µÄ·¥¥·¥± {name} ‰πÇ ùï∂ùñìùñéùñåùñçùñôùñò"</p>

         <h2>Our History</h2>
         <p>The knights was supposed to be just a Telegram group, but a sudden change of mind urged us to open a network, it was 2022 <a href="htpls://t.me/hope_to_kil">Deadly Knigh</a> ( Founder of Knights ) created a Telegram group named ( Get All Your Anime Series And Movies Here ), slowly members started to join the group, on march 15 someone named <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> joined the group, he motivated everyone to change the group name and earned the trust of the owner, slowly they became best friends and <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> became the manager of the group. <br><br> Once someone named Dyno entered the group and tried to destroy it, but somehow he couldn't, he had three accounts and later they got Gbanned by <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a>.</p>

         <h2>Birth of the network</h2>
         <p><a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> was so good at handling bots and made an own personal bot for the knights group, which made the owner happy and satisfied, so <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> was granted as the Co-owner of the group, as you know <strong><em>"Great power comes with great responsiblities"</em></strong>. so he was responsible for managing the group and named as owner. <br><br> Then some guys named <a href="https://t.me/Kirito18115">Kirito</a> and <a href="https://t.me/serenaayako0113">Serena Ayako</a> joined the group, one admin of the knights direct messaged a girl which was an 18+ and dirty message, he repeated the same thing in the group again, so she got angry and blocked his phone number and her boyfriend <a href="https://t.me/Kirito18115">Kirito</a> slayed and Gbanned him from some bots, by seeing <a href="https://t.me/serenaayako0113">Serena Ayako</a> as telegram official, she was appointed as an admin in The Knights along with <a href="https://t.me/Kirito18115">Kirito</a>. <br><br> Later on everyone in the group were talking about <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> and a network stuff, so the Founders of The Knights thought of opening a network, but, to do this they needed help of <a href="https://t.me/serenaayako0113">Serena Ayako</a> and <a href="https://t.me/Kirito18115">Kirito</a> to advice them and order them what to do as they are admins in another 2 networks, they opened a network finally, but due to some personal issues <a href="https://t.me/Shoshuke_bot">Shouko</a> can't be online on Telegram much, so someone named <a href="https://t.me/Lost_emotion">Prime Lost</a> does the same job as her, and declined to get the credits or to be an admin in The Knights, hence we gave the birth to our official network called <strong><em>"Knights Association"</em></strong></p>
